      <p>Our life in the past year has changed a lot in many ways and all for the better! I know we've had highs and lows, we haven't seen each other much these past months and it was tough, but as always we made it through! Now, since it is because of the course, it was only a matter of time before I would have used these new skills for you! Hahaha</p>

      <p>Anyway, this is not why I'm doing this... I'm not good with words, you know that, you're much better, so I'm just going to tell you how much I love you. You are my life, my air, my life, MY EVERYTHING!</p>

      <p>But hey, I tell you that every single day and you're here for your Christmas present, right?! So let's go check it out then!</p>
